# LSTM-Algorithm-to-Predict-Time-Series
Long Short Term Memory algorithm to predict Stock price.


In this practice, I’ve used Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm to make a prediction about some stock prices. 

Nowadays, as everybody know, the inflation rates of countries are getting increased day by day. It leads some people to invest their money to something, which can save their money against inflation.

At this point, the stock markets include itself to portfolio of some people. There are lots of ways for making prediction about future of stock prices. 

In my internship at Şeker Invest, I’ve approached to stock markets with an innovative way. Instead of using technical analysis and fundamental analysis, I’ve handled LSTM algorithm. 

In fundamental analysis, there are lots of variable to calculate in order to reach the price of stock in future so that it will take too much time. In technical analysis, graphics can be interpreted differently depending on technical analysts. Therefore, the idea that deep learning methods can be used for predicting stock prices is have entered my head.

Summary;

I’ve handled some of XU100 and NASDAQ stocks to predict their future value. While I’m doing it, I’ve used a python library, which is yfinance to scrap their historical values. That’s why you are not going to find a dataset that published by me. You are going to be able to reach the historical datas by piece of codes in starting lines. Thus, you can change the whatever stock you want to make a prediction by using their codes in YahooFinance.

I’ll have been uploading different scripts, which contains LSTM models per stocks. With doing this, you are going to face different type of pieces of codes, which can establish LSTM model. Therefore, I’m going to explain the how LSTM algorithm is gonna be able to built in only one script. I’m going to use same notations at the different scripts so that there will be no chance for misunderstanding. (Descriptions will be in LSTM.py) 

Let’s skip to the code section.
